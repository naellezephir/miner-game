# miner-game

Implementation of a simulation game similar to “Warcraft,” consisting of objects located in a two-dimensional world that move around and behave in various ways. The user enters commands to tell the objects what to do, and they behave in simulated time. Simulated time advances one “tick” or unit at a time. Time is “frozen” while the user enters commands. When the user commands the program to “go”, time will advance one tick of time. When the user commands the program to “run”, time will advance several units of time until some significant event happens 

Commands:
move
work at a mine
stop
go
run
quit
